# tr-portfolio :: Trevor Rowland's Professional Portfolio

A Professional Portfolio built with NextJS and deployed using Vercel.

To customize this portfolio for yourself, edit the Markdown Files in `src/content/` to contain your resume's content. The sections that can be edited in Markdown are:

- Summary (`Summary.md`): This is your name, field and a sentence or two to describe yourself.

- Abstract (`Abstract.md`): This is an intro to your portfolio. Outline your story and what you're all about here so readers get an idea of who you are.

- Education (`Education.md`): This is where you can add any higher education, bootcamps, or other education experience you have.

- Work Experience (`Experience.md`): This is where you can add your previous work experience.

- Research (`Research.md`): If you have been involved in research (I have not), this is where you can add any relevant research you have been involved in. To add this to the deployed website, make sure you un-comment the HTML and JavaScript needed to display this category in `src/app/page.tsx`.

- Certificates (`Certificates.md`): You can include any certificates you have received here. I have added my Linkedin Learning certificates as links to the certificates online. Please follow the formatting to ensure that the links are displayed and open correctly.

## NextJS Boilerplate ReadMe

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
